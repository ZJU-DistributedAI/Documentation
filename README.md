# Documentation Repository

This is the github repository for all documentations, papers, architectures and more.


Please find the [current architecture for the distributed AI demo](demo_architect.md) we are working on. In this demo we are planning to implement a blockchain based system using go-ethereum. On this platform simple integer homomorphic encryption could be used to perform secure vanilla deep learning inference and training. MPC + Federated learning is intended to be used to aggregate all weights for the models from clients, and push it to the server to update.

Additionally we have  a [Papers implementation playground documentation](papers.md). This file keeps tracking what we did, what we are doing and what we plan to do in the future. We will jointly maintain this list.
